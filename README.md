## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Insights
During the exploratory data analysis phase, several patterns and insights have emerged from the incidents data in Hartford, Connecticut. These findings shed light on the nature of incidents and can inform decision-making and resource allocation for law enforcement agencies. Here are some key patterns identified:


### Geospatial Analysis
1. Hotspots: Certain neighborhoods in Hartford exhibited higher incident rates, indicating localized areas of concern. These hotspots can be targeted for focused law enforcement efforts and resource allocation.
2. Pareto Analysis: I tried to use Pareto analysis to indentify key areas contributing to a significant portion of total incidents were identified. Addressing the root causes in these areas can have a substantial impact on reducing overall incidents in the city.

These findings from the geographical analysis provide valuable insights for law enforcement agencies to prioritize and implement targeted interventions, ultimately improving public safety in Hartford.

### Temporal Patterns:

1. Monthly Variation: Analysis of incidents on a monthly basis revealed fluctuations in the number of reported incidents throughout the year. This understanding of monthly patterns can assist in identifying seasonal trends and planning resource allocation accordingly.
2. Seasonal Patterns: By examining incidents data on a seasonal basis, distinct patterns emerged that aligned with changes in weather, holidays, or other seasonal factors. This information can guide law enforcement in anticipating and preparing for specific challenges during different seasons.
3. Daily Analysis: Daily patterns in incidents shed light on variations in criminal activity throughout the day. Identifying peak periods can aid in scheduling patrols and allocating resources more effectively.
4. Hourly Patterns: Further analysis at an hourly level revealed specific time periods when incidents were more likely to occur. Understanding these patterns can assist in optimizing law enforcement presence and response during critical hours.

These temporal insights provide valuable information for law enforcement agencies to implement proactive strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and improve incident response in Hartford.

### Neighborhood Analysis:

1. Top Crimes: Through the analysis of incidents data, the top crime types prevalent in each neighborhood were identified. This information allows law enforcement agencies to prioritize their efforts and allocate resources effectively to address the specific crime challenges in each neighborhood.
2. Time Analysis: Additionally, the analysis revealed insights into the timing of crimes in different neighborhoods. By understanding the temporal patterns, law enforcement can strategically plan patrols and increase surveillance during the periods when criminal activity is more likely to occur.

These neighborhood-level findings provide actionable information for law enforcement agencies to focus their efforts, implement targeted strategies, and enhance community safety in Hartford.
